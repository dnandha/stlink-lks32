# ST-Link LKS32
This repository provides instructions on how to dump and flash LKS32 microcontroller units (MCUs) using a standard ST-Link probe, and how to modify certain parameters. Please check the [Disclaimer](#disclaimer) before proceeding.

## Installation
1. Install python
2. Install `pyocd` with pip: `pip install pyocd`
3. Download [Pack](Linko.LKS08x.1.1.4.pack) ([Source](https://www.lksmcu.com/static/upload/file/20230113/Linko.LKS08x_v1.14.zip))

Note: These examples use a LKS08x package. You can apply the procedure to a different MCU series using the appropriate Pack file.

## Basic procedure

### Hookup ST-Link

The image is showing Brightway "3 Lite" controller.

### Dump flash
Using `pyocd` and the Pack file downloaded before:

`python -m pyocd cmd -c savemem 0 0x10000 mcu_fw.bin --pack Linko.LKS08x.1.1.4.pack --target lks32mc081c8t8`

### Modify bin
Copy `mcu_fw.bin` to `mcu_fw_mod.bin` and make changes. See [Modifications](#modifications) for examples.

### Write bin back to flash
Using `pyocd` and the Pack file downloaded before:

`python -m pyocd load mcu_fw_mod.bin --pack Linko.LKS08x.1.1.4.pack --target lks32mc081c8t8`

#### Restore original binary
Simply run the above command with `mcu_fw.bin` instead of `mcu_fw_mod.bin`.

Advise: Keep the original binary in a safe place!

## Modifications
### Change SN of Brightway controller
1. Download the [SN script](bw_change_sn.py)
2. Using the script:

`python bw_change_sn.py mcu_fw_mod.bin <SN>`

For `<SN>` check the following table.

#### Serial Number Prefixes (Global)

| Model   | SN    |
|---------|-------|
| 3 Lite  | 35793 |
| 4       | 46441 |
| 4 Lite  | 46419 |
| 4 Ultra | 37829 |
